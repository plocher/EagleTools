CAM files for use with EagleCAD
===============================
These CAM jobs create the files needed to have a PCB created.  These files, zipped together, are the only files you need to have a PCB made at nearly any fab house.

  * SPCoast-gerb274x-PanelSilk.cam
    * For use with panelized designs that have component names copied to the _tNames layer 125.

  * SPCoast-gerb274x-Singleton.cam
    * For use with singleton designs that have component names in the tNames layer 25. 

  * SPCoast-gerb274x-Values.cam
    *  For use with singleton or panelized designs, when component values are desired INSTEAD of component names. 

  * SPCoast-gerb274x-noPartInfo.cam
    *  For use with Singleton or panelized designs that do not desire component names OR values to show up on the PCB.
